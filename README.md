# AllThisText
Fan-made recreation of the text adventure game in Jonathan Coulton's "All This Time" music video.

You can play through it by running it from the CLI, e.g.:
    * python AllThisText.py

Or you can cheat and read the text directly in the file, because you're a winner.

Game is best viewed running in an 80x24 terminal.
